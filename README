# üí° ISAH Part Creation Assistant  

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Overview and Important Context  
During my time at Legend Fleet Solutions, (a vehicle upfit manufacturing company) I created this **VBA Macro** to streamline the process of entering records into the company's ISAH ERP database.

## üöö About Legend Fleet Solutions  
Legend Fleet Solutions manufactures various **vehicle parts**, including:

- **Flooring, insulated wall liners, ceilings, and other insulation components.**
- **Each part requires a corresponding record in the ERP system, linking all necessary files for manufacturing.**
- **These files include:**
  - Production files for manufacturing machines.
  - Product images and technical drawings.
  - Any documentation required to reproduce the part from scratch.

## üî¢ Part Numbers  
Each part variation is tracked using a **specialized SKU** called a **Part Number**, which contains important details such as:

- Product Type.
- Vehicle Type.
- Model Year.
- Other relevant specifications.

All records in the **ERP System** are centered around **Part Numbers**.

## üîÑ Revision Numbers  
Parts are designed by **specialized engineers**, and at times, revisions are necessary due to:

- Misfitting.
- Incorrect Dimensions.
- Other manufacturing issues.

These revisions are tracked using a **Revision Number**.  
For a directory to be accurate, it must contain files **with the same revision numbers**. Any inconsistencies could cause incorrect production, resulting in **customer dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies**.

## üèóÔ∏è Manual Entry & Search Process (Before Automated Creation)  
Prior to creating this operation, creating records in the ISAH ERP system was a **long and tedious** process.

- **Redundant steps** and **manual file searching** made this process inefficient.
- Manual errors in **file naming, folder structures, and missing files** caused frequent delays.
- The entire process was **very time-consuming**.

## ‚ö° Impact of My Macro  
To optimize and automate this process, I developed a **VBA Macro** that:

- **Reduced processing time by 95% by automatically pulling data from part directories.**
- **Consolidated all required files and file paths into a single Excel sheet.**
- **Reduced inconsistencies by 95% by cross-referencing revision numbers of all files within part directory.**
- **Saved hours of time processing records manually.**

While full automation into the ERP was possible, an element of **manual review was necessary** due to inconsistencies in original **file and folder names**.
