Purpose: I created this VBA Macro to simplify part entry process of records into a manufacturing company's ISAH database. Heres what is does:

-Quickly validates part folder structure and revision consistency. (In a manufacturing setting, ensuring that the correct revision is being used as well as a valid folder is paramount to ensuring seamless operations)
-Utilizes VBA algorithm to traverse part directory and consolidates ISAH part entry fields into single interface, including Shop Image, Production Files, Image, and Drawing.
