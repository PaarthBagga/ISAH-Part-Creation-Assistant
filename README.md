<h1>Purpose:</h1> 
During my time at Legend Fleet Solutions (Vehicle upfit manufacturing company) I created this VBA Macro to make entering records into the company's ISAH (ERP) database easier. Heres what is does:

-Traverses directory of record and extracts relevant data from specific folders.<br>
-Parses information into a format enterable in the ERP. <br>
-Quickly validates part folder structure and revision consistency. (In a manufacturing setting, ensuring that the correct revision is being used as well as a valid folder is paramount to ensuring seamless operations) <br>
-Flags any missing folders or files crucial to the manufacturing process. <br>
